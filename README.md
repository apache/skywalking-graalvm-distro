GraalVM compiles your Java applications ahead of time into standalone binaries. These binaries are smaller, start up to 100x faster, 
provide peak performance with no warmup, and use less memory and CPU than applications running on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

SkyWalking GraalVM Distro is a re-distribution version of the official Apache SkyWalking OAP server.


## ⚠️ Release Policy ⚠️
This repository is only on the experimental stage, no release will be made and driven by the PMC by the current status, until we have a way out.
