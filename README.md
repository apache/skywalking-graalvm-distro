GraalVM compiles your Java applications ahead of time into standalone binaries. These binaries are smaller, start up to 100x faster, 
provide peak performance with no warmup, and use less memory and CPU than applications running on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

SkyWalking GraalVM Distro is a re-distribution version of the official Apache SkyWalking OAP server.
This distro could bring the OAP benefits from the native build powered by Graal VM.
But as the limitation of the GraalVM, this distro may provide features in different implementations, and require recompilation 
rather than change config files.
